# Mapper Module Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Mapper Module. It provides a user interface for managing data mappings, including template downloads, file uploads, and data saving functionality.

## Features

1. Modern and responsive user interface built with Next.js
2. Material UI and Ant Design components for a polished look
3. Dark mode support
4. CSV file upload and download functionality
5. Draft saving capability
6. Form validation and error handling

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## reCAPTCHA Configuration

For environments without internet access, you can disable the Google reCAPTCHA verification on the login page.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory (if it doesn't exist already)
2. Add the following environment variable:

```
# Set to 'false' to disable reCAPTCHA verification
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECAPTCHA=false
```

This will disable the reCAPTCHA component completely, allowing users to log in without verification.

If you want to enable reCAPTCHA:

```
# Enable reCAPTCHA (default)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECAPTCHA=true

# Also provide a valid site key
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key_here
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
